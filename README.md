## Spatial Image Steganalysis using Transfer Learning Approach on Embedded JPEG Images

### Abstract
Steganalysis is the process of revealing the hidden messages embedded
inside an image. For many years Ensemble Classifiers were used to identify the
presence of hidden messages in images until recently, researchers started using
deep learning, specifically Convolution Neural Networks, for this purpose. Deep
learning is a method of training a model architecture over a large-scale, relevant
and diverse dataset. In this paper, we have studied the effects of 3 transfer
learning models in detecting the presence of hidden messages in images.
MobileNet, EfficientNetB3, and ResNet50 models are used as the base-models
pre-trained over the imagenet dataset. These models are then combined with our
outer model and trained over our proposed dataset, hence accomplishing the aim
of using transfer learning. Previous researches experimented with BOSSbase,
WOW and/or S-UNIWARD images with different payload rates. In this paper,
the dataset consists of the combination of images on which embedding
algorithms, namely JMiPOD, J-UNIWARD and UERD are applied. We have also
aimed to determine the possible reasons behind the results we observed in our
research.
